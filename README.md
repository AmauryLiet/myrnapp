Done following https://gist.github.com/Polaris-Dust/90af2ce157ee02dc57d3d86c4b619204


# Foreseen improvements

- Remove hard-coded values
    * App.js:77
- Make image height be the one of the screen, and not the one of its parent
    * App.js:70
- Simplify the renderBody function, by creating components (for instance "AdditionalDescription" with a boolean prop "display")
    * App.js:30

## on a larger run

- Add flow on the project
- Test the component behaviour when "More info" is pressed
